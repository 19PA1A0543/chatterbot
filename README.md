# chatterbot


link for my heroku app: https://kootarapalli-services.herokuapp.com/

We created a site based on html and css. This site is a company for transporting of products from online shopping malls like flipkart and amazon

In this site one can know about the site by clicking on ABOUTUS button . By clicking orders button one can search their [product with the id given by the mall. It shows details of product like estimated delivery , shipment status, picture of product , along with your profile .

we have done this site by using python flask . we have imported flask and with the help of @app.route we have done this by redirecting to the other html page. we added a bot named Alex which can help you and simplify the work by just messaging it it displays direct links to other pages. we have done this by using chatterbot.

Finally we have deployed this site with heroku app to get into online.

Each and every file is provided for future purposes. Hope everyone likes it.
